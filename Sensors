The proyect works with an RFID RC5222, a FLAsh module, a Proximity sensor SR501, a microservomotor, a 4x4 keypad, gas sensor and the temperature sensor and LCD on the mbed board. 

It also contains an ADC module which waits to receive signals from two different analog circuits.
One measures the overall power consumption of the system and the other one is a piezoelectric sensor embbeded in a wheatstone bridge circuit.
